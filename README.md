# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The page isn't very responsive. Using absolute positioning on the images and giving them static sizing for example creates issues when the browser window is reduced in size. Same thing for the videos in the receipes section.

Beyond that, the margins aren't to my liking but I'm following the brief! I also think it would be fun to add a few animations throughout to make the page unique and engaging.
